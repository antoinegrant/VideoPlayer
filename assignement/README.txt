Video Practical

Create a frontend playlist video experience from a sample data feed of Travel content.

Use the provided json data file and create a playlist with an HTML5 video element.

- The json file can be loaded from any local server (apache, nodejs…)
- You can use an html5 video tag. There is no need to build a player.
- You can use the native controls on the video tag.
- Use any libraries you like…  i.e. jquery...
- The UI should be responsive to mobile
- There should be a video on the page with 4 clickable images that will load and play the appropriate video.
- There should be a visual indicator to highlight which video is playing.
- The UI should be clean, presentable, NYTimesian...
- When you load the page the first video should not autoplay, but display a poster frame image.
- Once playback is completed the video should autoplay to the next video in the playlist.
- On completion of the playlist, the playlist should roll over and start from the beginning again.

Treat this as though you would release it to production.

This should be representative of how you would approach a problem that you would feel comfortable launching.  The length of time spent to complete this exercise will not affect our evaluation. We understand that you are likely to have many things, both personally and professionally, that may slow you down. Your code will, however, be evaluated for style, simplicity and maintainability.

If there are any questions please reach out.
